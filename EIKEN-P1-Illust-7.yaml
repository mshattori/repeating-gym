Picture-1: One day, a man was watching a TV program.
Sample-1:
  - One day, a man was watching a TV program.
  - The program was about endangered wild animals in the savanna such as African elephants.
  - It said that illegal hunting caused the decline in the number of wild animals.
  - The man looked concerned about the animals. A few days later,
  - the man found eco-tours that a travel agency was offering on the Internet.
  - The website said that people could help save animals by going on such tours,
  - so he decided to sign up for one. Two months later, the man was taking part in the tour.
  - The man and many participants were on a bus in the savanna.
  - They were looking over the side and watching African elephants.
  - The bus was very crowded with people, and there were other buses nearby.
  - A few weeks later, the man was watching the news on TV.
  - He saw that there had been a collision between buses that were taking people on eco-tours.
  - The newscaster said there were too many eco-tours in the area.
Question: Please look at the fourth picture. If you were the man, what would you be thinking?
Sample-Answer-1: Most of all, I'd be hoping that no one got injured. However, I'd also be thinking that, since the tours might now be canceled, I was lucky to have the opportunity to go there before the accident.
Sample-Answer-2: I'd be thinking that it must have been wrong of the eco-tour companies to conduct the tours without paying enough attention to safety. I'd consider it carefully before going on such a tour again.
